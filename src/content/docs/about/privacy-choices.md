# PRIVACY CHOICES

At this page you can exercise your privacy rights and make choices about our collection and use of your data.

## Your Account

All registered users may review, update or correct the Identity, Contact and Profile data by changing their "user preferences" in their account. To delete your account entirely, please follow these steps.

## Your Legal Rights

Depending on the laws where you live, you may have one or more of the following rights under local laws. Airdb extends these rights to all individuals, regardless of where they live, including the right to:

- Request a copy of personal data we have collected about you
- Opt-out of our sale or sharing of personal data about you
- Request that we delete data we have collected about you
- Request that we correct data, restrict our use of data, or delete sensitive personal data that you may have previously provided (due to technical limitations, all of these requests will be handled as requests to delete data)

## How To Make a Request

If you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact us through our support portal. You will be required to complete an email verification process to ensure that your data is not accessed inappropriately by someone else. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for a copy of your data twice within a 12-month period. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. If your request cannot be fulfilled, we will inform you of the reason.

## Cookies

We strive to make the Airdb experience as personalized and relevant as possible for all users. In doing so, we collect data via cookies to deliver targeted content and services on websites that use Airdb, as well as other websites you may visit. If you prefer to opt-out of this information being collected, you may do so by clicking on the "opt-out" button below. For logged-in users, when you opt-out, we will remember your preference across all Airdb services. As long as you are logged in, you will not have to opt-out again.

For logged-out users, when you opt-out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to use your information for targeting. Note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.

Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of targeted services from Airdb, you will still see our content, they just won't be targeted to you based on your interaction with our Services, Partner Sites or third-party sites. The content you continue to see may be selected based on information such as your age or gender or other demographic information.

## Declining Cookies

If you do not want to accept our cookies, you can adjust your browser settings to decline cookies. You should note, however, that certain areas of the Site may not operate properly if you decide not to accept cookies.

## Managing Email Preferences

You may opt-out of newsletters and promotional emails from us at any time by using the opt-out mechanism contained in such emails (also referred to as "unsubscribe"). You may also unsubscribe or manage your email subscription through your account settings. Please note, unsubscribing from Airdb emails will unsubscribe you from all Airdb notification emails and digest emails. You will still receive transactional emails necessary for the Airdb service to function, these include, but may not be limited to, emails confirming you created a new account, emails helping you reset your password etc.
