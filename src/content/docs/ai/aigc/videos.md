"If you're into Seinfeld, and you have seen all episodes, here AI creates a never ending stream of new unseen stuff: <https://www.twitch.tv/watchmeforever>
Seinfeld first aired in 1989, running for nine seasons. Its popularity has prevailed, so many years later, with demand continuing until present day(Opens in a new window). But an unlikely occurrence has come from this: an AI-generated episode of the hit show is being live-streamed on Twitch, in a never-ending loop.
Entitled Nothing, Forever(Opens in a new window), the infinite episode/show features mechanical characters and pixelated animation. Jerry, Kramer, Elaine and George, the main characters, remain the fixation of the show, but they exist in contemporary New York. The foursome oscillate between their apartments and Jerry's stand-up setting, with an occasional laugh track erupting in the background."
